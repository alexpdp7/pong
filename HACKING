Important

Currently everything (pgtap included) needs to be in a schema named "pong".

Tests

Tests need pgtap, to install it on Debian:

$ sudo apt-get install pgxnclient libtap-parser-sourcehandler-pgtap-perl postgresql-server-dev-9.4
$ sudo pgxn install pgtap

and load /usr/share/postgresql/9.4/extension/pgtap--0.95.0.sql in your
database.

To run the tests:

$ pg_prove test.sql  # you can use -d dbname to choose the database
